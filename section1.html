        Prior to 2010 many gun laws were established that impacted the gun use that year. For example, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was signed by President George Bush to prevent gun manufacturers from being named in federal or state suits, as well as the National Instant Criminal Background Check Improvement Act was signed that required background checks for gun-buyers and prohibitted the mentallly ill from purchasing firearms. After George Bushes term, President Barack Obama signed a federal law that allowed gun owners to bring firearms into national parks (Gray, S 2018).
