        <h1>Gun Crime in Seattle</h1>
        <p> Gun crime in highly populated areas is important to study in order to ensure the safety of many. 
            <strong>Seattle</strong> is a largely populated city in <em>Washington State</em> and the gun crime trends in this area can help policy makers understand the impacts their policies have on the safety of society. 
            Looking at how gun crime changed throughout time and correlating the amount with the gun policies placed recent to that year can help explain what gun policies were effective.
